# Advent of Code 2022 - My solutions in Kotlin

## Usage of the template for new / daily problem statements

1. Copy `DayTemplate.kt` to `DayXX.kt`.
2. Update the `day` parameter of the `aocTaskWithExample` function call.  
3. Paste inline example to `val example`, in case of multiple examples, use `listOf()` (then change the
   function call from `aocTaskWithExample` to `aocTaskWithExamples` .
4. Adjust expected output of the first part from text (parameter `expectedOutputPart1` of functions `aocTaskWithExample`
   and `aocTaskWithExamples`); use `listOf()` in case of multiple examples.
5. Download the puzzle input to file `input/2022_day_XX.txt`.
6. Solve the first part of the problem statement in the function `private fun part1(input: List<String>)`.
7. Run the main function and check the output. The examples are tested before using the puzzle input.
8. Solve the second part of the problem statement in the function `private fun part2(input: List<String>)`.
9. Uncomment the reference to the function `part2` in the function call `aocTaskWithExample` or `aocTaskWithExamples`.
